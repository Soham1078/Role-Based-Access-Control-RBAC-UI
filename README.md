# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-UI
RBAC UI System
Welcome to the RBAC UI System! This project provides an intuitive user interface for managing roles, permissions, and user access rights in applications. The system ensures secure, efficient, and scalable access control for organizations.

🚀 Features
Role Management: Create, edit, delete, and view roles with assigned permissions.
User Management: Assign roles to users, view user permissions, and manage user access.
Permission Management: Granular control over permissions to define precise access levels.
Audit Logs: Track changes in roles, permissions, and user assignments.
Permissions Matrix: A visual representation of which roles have access to specific resources.
Security Enhancements: Two-factor authentication (2FA), access control checks, and notifications for critical actions.

⚡ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the RBAC UI System on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
A backend API for managing RBAC (ensure you have an API ready, or use the included mock API in /services).
Installationv
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui-system.git
cd rbac-ui-system

⚡ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the RBAC UI System on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm or yarn
A backend API for managing RBAC (ensure you have an API ready, or use the included mock API in /services).
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-ui-system.git
cd rbac-ui-system
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
# or
yarn install
Configure environment variables:

Rename .env.example to .env.
Set the required environment variables (e.g., API_URL for the backend).
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
# or
yarn start
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, React Router
State Management: Redux (or Context API, depending on implementation)
UI Framework: Material-UI (MUI) or Tailwind CSS
Backend: RESTful API (or GraphQL)
Authentication: JWT, OAuth2 (optional for higher security)
📖 Usage
Role Management
Navigate to the Roles section.
Create a new role by clicking the "Add Role" button.
Assign permissions to the role and save changes.
User Management
Navigate to the Users section.
Select a user and assign one or more roles.
Save changes to update user access.
Permissions Management
Navigate to the Permissions section.
Edit existing permissions or add new permissions to roles.
🧪 Testing
Run tests to ensure the system works as expected:

bash
Copy code
npm test
# or
yarn test
📂 Deployment
To deploy the RBAC UI System, build the application and deploy it to a hosting service:
